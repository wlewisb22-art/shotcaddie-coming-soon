      <h2>What is Shot Caddie?</h2>
      <p>
        Shot Caddie is a smart, automated shot and cocktail dispenser built to help you load your favorite spirits and mixers,
        discover what you can make, and pour consistent drinks quickly.
      </p>

      <h2>How many bottles can it hold?</h2>
      <p>
        Shot Caddie is designed around a <strong>16-bottle</strong> system so you can stock a wide range of spirits, liqueurs, juices, and mixers.
      </p>

      <h2>Does it support AI?</h2>
      <p>
        Shot Caddie is designed to support an <strong>optional AI-enabled mixologist</strong> experience that can suggest drinks,
        recommend swaps, and help you discover combinations based on what’s loaded. (AI features may vary at launch.)
      </p>

      <h2>Is it only for shots?</h2>
      <p>
        Not at all — it’s designed for shots and cocktails. Your recipe library and what you stock in the 16 slots determines what’s available.
      </p>

      <h2>How do consistent pours work?</h2>
      <p>
        Shot Caddie is built around calibration so timing can be tuned per ingredient (spirits vs. juices) to improve consistency over time.
      </p>

      <h2>When will it be available?</h2>
      <p>
        Target release is <strong>Q2 2026</strong>. Join the early access list on the homepage for updates.
